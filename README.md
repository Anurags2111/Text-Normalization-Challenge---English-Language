# Google Text Normalization Challenge: English Language¶
Text normalization is defined as the process of transforming text into a single canonical form. Normalizing text before storing or processing it, allows for separation of concerns, since input is then guaranteed to be consistent before operations are performed on it.

Text normalization has seen a huge advancement in technology with the implementation of deep neural networks. Advancements in AI and Processing power has enabled us to process enormous amounts of data rapidly learning from them and producing reliable outputs as required.

Google’ text normalization challenge follows the aftermath of a research paper produced by Google researchers Richard Sporat and Navdeep Jaitly. What they have been trying to do is to design a deep neural network to automate the process of text normalization, given a corpus of labeled text data in the order of a few billion words along with their normalized function.

The goal of this research is to produce DNN model which can efficiently translate written format input into readable output. Example: “15/1/1995” to “Fifteenth January Nineteen Ninety-Five.”
